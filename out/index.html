<ul>
<li>When a philosopher gets it wrong, no one dies.</li>
<li>Philosophers have inspired the world, their ideas live long after they have physically disappeared from the planet.</li>
<li><em>A philosopher does not try to comfort the afflicted, but he/she will definitely afflict the comforted.</em></li>
<li><strong>Ph.D.</strong> = doctor of PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ul>

<li>वेदत्रयी (vedatrayI) -&gt; the understanding of vedas to understand Dharma</li>

<li>Ānvīkṣikī is the <strong>systematic / intellectual inquiry</strong> without alluding any scriptural and spiritual leanings as it is the labour of human intellect and reasoning or logic.</li>
<li>Ānvīkṣikī is ever accepted to be the lamp of all branches of learning, the means for all kinds of activities and the basis of all virtues.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any utility; or not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answer can, as a rule, be known to be true, but <strong>for the sake of questions themselves.</strong> Because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic and fundamentalist approach which closes the mind against speculation and open mindedness.</em></li>

<p><strong>Passage: Bihadarnyaka Upanishad Chapter 3, Section 9</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In this passage from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Vidagdha asks Yājñavalkya about the number and nature of gods. Yājñavalkya responds by stating that there are various levels of gods, ranging from three hundred and three to one. He explains that these numbers represent different manifestations of divine beings.</li>
<li>Yājñavalkya then identifies the thirty-three primary gods, which include the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, Indra, and Prajāpati. Each of these gods has a specific domain or function in the universe.</li>
<li>The text also explores the significance of different deities associated with various directions. For instance, the sun is associated with the east, Yama with the south, Varuna with the west, Soma with the north, and fire with the fixed direction above. These deities are linked to elements and concepts in the world.</li>
<li>Yājñavalkya emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of these deities and their relationship to the heart, which is considered the center of the self. He stresses that all these deities and aspects of existence ultimately rest on the heart, symbolizing the unity of the divine and the individual.</li>
<li>The passage concludes with a challenge from Yājñavalkya, demanding knowledge of the transcendent, all-encompassing being that underlies everything. When Śākalya fails to provide this knowledge, he loses his head, symbolizing the consequences of ignorance.</li>
<li>In the end, Yājñavalkya demonstrates a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the divine, the self, and the universe, emphasizing the importance of realizing the ultimate truth or Brahman.</li>

<h2 id="42-the-middleway---buddhist-thought">4.2 The MiddleWay - Buddhist Thought</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Middle Way</em> {<em>मध्यम-प्रतिपदा</em>} in <strong>Buddhism</strong> avoids the extremes of self-gratification (<em>hedonism</em>) on one hand and self-mortification (<em>asceticism</em>) on the other.</li>
<li>The Buddha understood and thought the two characteristics of the middle path -
<ol>
<li><strong>Dependent Origination -</strong> The Law of Dependent Origination explains the process of human activity.</li>
<li><strong>Eightfold Path -</strong> The Noble Eightfold Path shows the way of practice that enables one to uplift oneself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="421-the-middle-path-of-the-buddhaa-life">4.2.1 The Middle Path of the Buddha'a Life</h3>
<h4 id="life-in-a-palace--">Life in a Palace -</h4>
<ul>
<li>He was brought up as a prince in a royal palace, fully unknown from any trace of <em>suffering</em>.</li>
<li>The Four Sights - {<em>Old age, Sickness, Death</em> and a <em>Religious Renouncer</em>} made him aware of suffering(1-3) and a possibility to get rid of it(4). So he left the palace to wander in the forest in search of truth. <strong>घर की मुर्ग़ी दाल बराबर ||</strong> :unamused:</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="life-in-the-forest--">Life in the Forest -</h4>
<ul>
<li>In forest, he spent periods learning from two different teachers but was not satisfied with their teaching.</li>
<li>He then met <em>5 ascetics</em>, who believed that practising austerities such as extreme fasting, bodily pain, etc would lead to rewards in a future life.</li>
<li>After excelling at austerities, he realised their limitations and recognised that to make further progress he needed <em>the Middle Way</em>.</li>
<li>He went on to find the balance between the two extremes that would liberate oneself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="422-the-middle-way-in-the-history-of-buddhist-ideas">4.2.2 The Middle Way in the History of Buddhist Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha, in his first teaching advocated a middle way that avoided the two extremes of <em>self-indulgence</em> &amp; <em>self-denial</em> as cited in <em>Dhamma-cakka-ppavattana Sutta</em> (<em>धम्मचक्कपवत्तन सुत्त</em>).</li>
<li>He presented the <strong>8-Fold Path</strong> as a path that follows the middle way.</li>
<li>In <em>Kaccayanagotta Sutta</em> (<em>काच्चायनगोत्त सुत्त</em>), he described middle way as free from the extremes of <em>eternalism</em> and <em>annhilationism</em>.</li>
<li>After Buddha's demise, Buddhist scholars formed different schools of thoughts based on their interpretations.</li>
<li>In 2^nd^ century AD, <strong>Nagarjuna</strong>, presented a very refined interpretation of middle-way and <em>Madhyamika</em> or middle-way school was formed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="423-the-middle-way-from-the-suttas">4.2.3 The Middle Way from the Suttas</h3>
<h4 id="4231-the-middle-way-and-the-buddhas-silence">4.2.3.1 The Middle Way and the Buddha's &quot;Silence&quot;</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha remained silent when he thought it would not be useful to answer metaphysical questions, and explained that metaphysical views were <em>unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4232-rely-on-ones-experience-rather-than-religious-authority">4.2.3.2 Rely on One’s Experience rather than Religious Authority</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the episode <em>Anguttara Nikaya</em> of <em>Kalama Sutta</em>, Buddha was asked for advise by villagers on which religious teacher to trust, to which he advised <em><strong>when you yourselves know</strong></em> that is one should consult our own experience rather than relying on religious authority.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4233-the-parable-of-the-boat">4.2.3.3 The Parable of the Boat</h4>
<ul>
<li>The parable of the boat/raft in <em>Majjhima Nikaya of Alagaddupamasutta</em> illustrates that like the boat left on the bank of the river, the teachings should be contingent and adaptable, not held as absolute metaphysical truths.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="424-the-philosophical-middle-way">4.2.4 The Philosophical Middle Way</h3>
<ul>
<li>Psychologically, the middle way describes the middle ground between <em>attachment</em> and <em>aversion</em>.</li>
<li>Philosophically, it is the middle position between <em>being</em> and <em>non-being</em>, between <em>form</em> and <em>emptiness</em>, between <em>free will</em> and <em>determinism</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="425-conclusion">4.2.5 Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha described himself as a <strong>vibhajyavādin</strong> (<em>one who asserts propositions conditionally</em>) rather than an <strong>ekāntavādin</strong> (<em>one who maintains one absolute position</em>).</li>
<li>“<em>Be a lamp unto yourself</em>,” says the Buddha. Your questions light the way in the <em>Kalama Sutta</em>.</li>
<li>The Middle Way is intended both as an <strong>ethical method</strong> and as a primer for <strong>correct reasoning</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>सर्वं दुःखं दुःखं; सर्वं क्षणिकं क्षणिकम्; सर्वं अनात्मं अनात्मम्।</strong></li>
<li>Nature of reality is being marked by three factors: suffering(<em>dhukh</em>), impermanance(<em>anitya</em>) and the lack of abiding self(<em>anatman</em>).</li>
</ul>
